## USBInjectAll.kext

In 10.11+ Apple has changed significantly the way the USB drivers work.  In the absense of a port injector, the drivers use ACPI to obtain information about which ports are active.  Often, this information is wrong.  Instead of correcting the DSDT, a port injector can be used (just as Apple did for their own computers).  But in order to create such an injector, you must first determine which ports are actually being used. And to do that you need to inject all ports so you can test all ports on the computer to determine which ones correspond to each available port address.  You can't test a port that is disabled...

That's where this kext comes in.

This kext attempts to inject all ports for each controller, and for hubs as well.  You can use this kext (temporarily) to enable all ports so you can determine which ports really need to be in the final injector.  Only the (potential) hub on EH01.PRT1 and EH02.PRT1 are injected.  Other hubs would require modifications.  So far, I haven't seen internal hubs connected to other ports.  The kext automatically determines the ports (and their addresses) based on the specifc USB controller chipsets.

EH01: 8-USB2 ports PR11-PR18.

EH02: 6-USB2 ports PR21-PR28.

EH01 hub: 8-USB2 ports HP11-HP18.

EH02 hub: 8-USB2 ports HP21-HP28.

XHC, 7-series chipset (8086:1e31): 4-USB2 ports HS01-HS04, 4-USB3 ports SS01-SS04.

XHC, 8/9-series chipset (8086:9xxx): 9-USB2 ports HS01-HS09, 6-USB3 ports SS01-SS06.

XHC, 8/9-series chipset (8086:8xxx): 14-USB2 ports HS01-HS14, 6-USB3 ports SS01-SS06.

XHC, 8/9-series chipset (8086:9cb1): 11-USB ports HS01-HS11, 4-USB3 ports SS01-SS04.

XHC, 100-series chipset (8086:a12f): 14-USB2 ports HS01-HS14, 10-USB3 ports SS01-SS10, plus USR1/USR2)

XHC, 100-series chipset (8086:9d2f): 10-USB2 ports HS01-HS10, 6-USB3 ports SS01-SS06, plus USR1/USR2)

XHC, 200-series/300-series chipset, etc.

This kext is only for 10.11+.  It has no use with prior versions.

Currently, only Intel controllers are supported.  The most commonly used SMBIOS model identifiers are in the kext.

Without a custom configuration, it is not intended that this kext be used long term.  It is best to create a custom injector containing only the ports that are active on the target machine, or to create an SSDT that customizes the port injection done by USBInjectAll.kext.  Customizing USBInjectAll.kext with an SSDT is covered later in this README.

For some chipsets, you may need to bypass the 15-port limit in 10.11.  In particular, XHCI controllers with device-id that starts with '8' will need the patch to bypass the limit.  The patch was created by arix98 and published on insanelymac.com here: http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/308325-guide-1011-full-speed-usb-series-89-keeping-vanilla-sle/page-9#entry2175618 (post #179 of that thread).

This kext requires only 20 ports maximum, so the patch would be:
(these patches are for 10.11.x only)

```
Comment: change 15 port limit to 20 in AppleUSBXHCIPCI
Name: AppleUSBXHCIPCI
Find: <83bd8cfe ffff10>
Replace: <83bd8cfe ffff15>
```

If you have a 100-series board, there can be up to 26 ports on XHCI, so you should increase the limit accordingly:
```
Comment: change 15 port limit to 26 in AppleUSBXHCIPCI
Name: AppleUSBXHCIPCI
Find: <83bd8cfe ffff10>
Replace: <83bd8cfe ffff1b>
```

You can copy/paste the patch from the file config_patches.plist that is checked into this project, which also has the patches for versions other than 10.11.x.  The config_patches.plist also contains the DSDT patches required to rename EHC1->EH01 and EHC2->EH02 which is important to avoid collisions between this kext and any built-in port injectors in the native kexts for your SMBIOS.

Note: Do not plan to use the patch long-term.  It could be problematic.  If you have more than 15 ports on XHC, you should use FakePCIID_XHCIMux to route the USB2 component of those USB3 ports to EHCI.  It is easy to stay under the limit if up to 8-USB2 ports are routed off XHC.

This kext may be helpful in installation scenarios as well where broken USB may prevent booting the installer from a USB stick.  It should work from EFI/Clover/kexts.


### Injected Property Customization

Two mechanisms are provided for customizing the injections that this kext performs.  Kernel flag 'uia_exclude' can be used to eliminate ports that would normally be injected.  uia_exclude takes is a string of characters with multiple port identifiers comma delimited.

For example, on my Lenovo u430 without FakePCIID_XHCIMux, bluetooth is on XHC at HS06. And the touchscreen is at HS01.  I can disable the touchscreen by booting with kernel flag uia_exclude=HS01, or with uia_exclude=HS06 disable bluetooth.  To disable both, uia_exclude=HS01,HS06.  With FakePCIID_XHCIMux, the touchscreen is on the hub on USB port1 on EH01.  To disable this hub port, uia_exclude=HP11.  You can easily see which devices are connected to which ports.  Each port identifier injected by the kext is unique, so you can easily identify each one.

In addition a few other flags are available:

flag -uia_exclude_hs: excludes all HSxx ports

flag -uia_exclude_ss: excludes all SSxx ports

flag -uia_exclude_xhc: disables injection on XHC

flag uia_include: to include certain ports even if would be normally excluded.  For example: -uia_exclude_hs uia_include=HS01 (to keep HS01 but exclude other HSxx)


But excluding ports doesn't give all the flexibility that might be needed.  All of the data in the Info.plist for ConfigurationData can be configured through ACPI.

For example, if we wanted to enable only SS01 on XHC for 8086_8xxx chipsets:

```
DefinitionBlock ("", "SSDT", 1, "hack", "UIAC", 0)
{
    Device(UIAC)
    {
        Name(_HID, "UIA00000")

        // override XHC configuration to have only one port
        Name(RMCF, Package()
        {
            "8086_8xxx", Package()
            {
                "port-count", Buffer() { 0xa, 0, 0, 0 },
                "ports", Package()
                {
                    "SS01", Package()
                    {
                        "UsbConnector", 3,
                        "port", Buffer() { 0xa, 0, 0, 0 },
                    }
                }
            }
        })
    }
}
```

An example is also provided in SSDT-UIAC.dsl.  All of the data injected for each type of device can be changed via this mechnanism.

The SSDT-UIAC-ALL.dsl contains the same data present in the Info.plist.  Using it would result in a net zero change.  You can use it as a template to establish your own custom SSDT for the specific USB configuration on your computer.  Delete ports you do not need.  Or change UsbConnector or portType to match your own USB hardware configuration.  All XHC identifiers (vendor_device) are included, so you should probably start by eliminating the configurations that don't apply to your XHC device, leaving only the configuration for your device.  You can see your device-id in ioreg under the XHC node (vendor-id and device-id).

### How to Install

Install the kext with your favorite kext installer, such as Kext Wizard.

Or install via Terminal:
```
sudo cp -R Release/USBInjectAll.kext /Library/Extensions
sudo touch /System/Library/Extensions && sudo kextcache -u /
```

Note: This kext assumes you already renamed EHC1->EH01 and EHC2->EH02.  It also assumes your XHCI controller is named XHC or XHCI (not renamed to XHC1).  These names EH01/EH02/XHC are best to avoid conflicts with built-in port injectors for Apple computers.  Refer to config_patches.plist in this repo for the patches required (config_patches.plist/ACPI/DSDT/Patches).


If you have a 9-series chipset XHC controller, 8086:8cb1, install XHCI-9-series.kext from the project as well.  The USB3 drivers will not load without this injector kext.  Update: As of 10.11.1, this injector is no longer needed as direct support was added.  If you need it, go back in history: https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-USB-Inject-All/tree/706fea51222eb73343d347db10cf48500333a7bd

Certain Intel xHCI controllers are not supported natively and require an injector.  For these systems, install XHCI-unsupported.kext.  The native support depends by version, you can check in /System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBHostFamily.kext/Contents/Plugins/AppleUSBXHCIPCI.kext/Contents/Info.plist to see if your xHCI is supported natively.

Because XHCI-unsupported.kext uses a lower IOProbeScore than the native Info.plist, there is no harm in installing it even if native support exists.

Typical xHCI needing XHCI-unsupported.kext:

X99-series chipset XHC controller, 8086:8d31
200-series chipset XHC controller, 8086:a2af (depends on macOS version)
300-series chipset XHC controller, 8086:a36d or 8086:9ded


### Build Environment

My build environment is currently Xcode, using SDK 10.11, targeting OS X 10.11. To override the SDK used during build, export `SDKDIR` with a path to the 10.11 kit.

Keep in mind the Info.plist is generated by generate_Info_plist.sh.  Do not edit the Info.plist directly.  USBInectAll_template-Info.plist serves as the starter Info.plist, with each model injected using USBInjectAll_model_template.plist.  This allows new models to be added easily by modifying the script.
